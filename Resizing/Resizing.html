<p>
  John Sherman (May 10, 1823 - October 22, 1900) was an American congressman and senator
  from Ohio during the Civil War and into the late nineteenth century. He was the principal
  author of the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, which was signed into law by President Benjamin
  Harrison. His brothers included General William Tecumseh Sherman, Judge Charles
  Taylor Sherman, and Hoyt Sherman, an Iowa banker.

  Born in Lancaster, Ohio, Sherman later moved to Mansfield, where he began a law career
  before entering politics. Initially a Whig, Sherman was among those anti-slavery activists
  who formed what became the Republican Party. He served three terms in the House of
  Representatives. As a member of the House, Sherman traveled to Kansas to investigate the
  unrest between pro- and anti-slavery partisans there. He rose in party leadership and was
  nearly elected Speaker in 1859. Sherman was elevated to the Senate in 1861. As a senator,
  he was a leader in financial matters, helping to redesign the United States' monetary
  system to meet the needs of a nation torn apart by civil war. After the war, he worked to
  produce legislation that would restore the nation's credit abroad and produce a stable,
  gold-backed currency at home.

  Serving as Secretary of the Treasury in the administration of Rutherford B. Hayes,
  Sherman continued his efforts for financial stability and solvency, overseeing an end
  to wartime inflationary measures and a return to gold-backed money. He returned to the
  Senate after his term expired, serving there for a further sixteen years. During that
  time he continued his work on financial legislation, as well as writing and debating
  laws on immigration, business competition law, and the regulation of interstate
  commerce. Sherman was the principal author of the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, which
  was signed into law by President Benjamin Harrison. In 1897, President William McKinley
  appointed him Secretary of State. Failing health and declining faculties made him
  unable to handle the burdens of the job, and he retired in 1898 at the start of the
  Spanishâ€“American War. Sherman died at his home in Washington, D.C. in 1900.
